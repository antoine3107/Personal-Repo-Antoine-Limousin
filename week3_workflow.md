# I] GitHub workflow tools

This section documents your practical work in week 3.

The main requirements are to show that:

To start with, let's look at the main workflow tools available on GitHub. 

1. Branches. 

Branches allow each team member to work on a different version of the project without interfering with the work of others.

2. Pull requests.

This is a feature that can be used by each team member to propose commits to be integrated into the main branch of the project.

3. Comments.

GitHub allows you to add comments to pull requests and commits. This facilitates collaboration, error detection and code quality improvement.

1. You know how to use the workflow tools in GitHub
2. You have successfully carried out the required operations which are:
   * Accept a task from the project backlog
   * Update the task information appropriately
   * Update the task board appropriately
   * Complete the development task on a feature branch
   * Commit your changes with appropriate comments
   * Check your work against the Definition of Done (DoD)
   * Make a pull request
	* small test

## II] Task completion

Here, you should use screenshots and descriptive commentary to show that the required
have been completed successfully.

To continue working in an organised way as a team, we've started using the zube.io platform, where we can use a Kanban board.

This board shows all the existing tasks in a project. These tasks are sorted by category: "Backlog", "Ready", "In Progress", "In Review", "Done".

Among the tasks available, I've selected "As a system administrator, I want to maintain reference values for room type". I immediately placed the card representing this task in the "In Progress" category.

To complete this task, I created a branch on which I wrote my code. Once development was complete, I committed the changes by bringing my code back to the main branch.

Finally, I made a pull request.

**DO**

* Consider the layout of your content from the point of view of the reader. Many raw
  screenshots will take up a lot of space. It may be better to adopt a different strategy
  such as
  * Using thumbnails with links to full-size images
  * Combining two or more screenshots into a single image 
  * Using partial screenshots to highlight only the important information
  * etc.
* Provide links to the actual objects (e.g. task, pull request, etc.) in the team project
  in GitHub
* Read through your work to make sure that the information comes across clearly

**DON'T**

* Use humour or informal language
* Waste space with trivial or self-evident commentary
* Abbreviate your commentary using (e.g. by using bullet points). Your text should be in
  the form of grammatically correct sentences.

## III] Reflection

Here, you should highlight any difficulties that you faced in completing the task, and
how you resolved them.

You should also briefly discuss the current process and how it could be refined or
improved in future iterations. For example, is the DoD adequate or too onerous? Is the
current procedure for updating the task appropriate? Is the task board configured to
work in an intuitive way?
