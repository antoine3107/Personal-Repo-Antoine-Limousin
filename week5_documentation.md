Meaningful names :

Rule: Choose variable, function and class names that are descriptive and meaningful. Avoid short or obscure names.
Explanation: Clear, explicit names make the code easier to understand, which in turn makes it more readable and maintainable.
Short functions :

Rule: Functions should be short and do just one thing. Ideally, they should be no longer than a few lines.
Explanation: Short functions are easier to understand and test. They encourage code reuse and make bugs easier to spot.
Relevant comments :

Rule: Use comments to explain the why, not the how. Comments should provide useful information, not just repeat code.
Explanation: Relevant comments help developers to understand the context and logic behind the code, which is particularly useful for subsequent maintenance.
Avoid duplicating code:

Rule: Don't duplicate code. Identify repeated parts and abstract them into reusable functions or classes.
Explanation: Duplicating code makes the source code more difficult to maintain, as changes have to be made in several places. By avoiding duplication, you reduce potential errors.
Separation of concerns :
Rule: Each component (function, class, module) should focus on a single task or concern. Avoid components that do too many things.
Explanation: Separating concerns makes code easier to understand, maintain and reuse. Each component has a clear purpose.
Unit testing :

Rule: Write unit tests for each function or method. The tests should be automated and able to detect bugs.
Explanation: Unit tests ensure that your code works properly and continues to do so when changes are made. They improve confidence in the code.
By following these "clean code" rules, you can make your code more readable, maintainable and robust. Each of these rules contributes to the overall quality of your code and makes it easier to collaborate with other developers.
