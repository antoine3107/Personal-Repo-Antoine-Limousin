```
using System;

namespace MyApplication
{
  class Program
  {
    static bool check(Int i) 
    {
        if (i % 2 == 0)
        {
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        //... Code not shown - ignore this line
    }  
  }
}
```

Comments on the problems
Incorrect method name: The check method uses a capital letter for the argument type (Int instead of int), which is incorrect in C#. The type should be lowercase (int).

Redundancy in the method: The check method contains unnecessary redundancy. It could be simplified to make the code more readable.

I will now create an improved version of the code and explain the improvements in the next step.

```
using System;

namespace MyApplication
{
    class Program
    {
        static bool IsEven(int number) 
        {
            return number % 2 == 0;
        }

        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            //... Code not shown - ignore this line
        }
    }
}
```

Explanation of improvements
Corrected method name: I've corrected the method name in IsEven to follow the naming conventions in C# where method names start with an uppercase letter.

Redundancy removed: I've removed the redundancy in the IsEven method. Instead of using an if structure to check whether a number is even and return true or false, I've directly returned the result of the expression number % 2 == 0. This simplifies the code and makes it more readable.

This improved version of the code conforms more closely to C# coding conventions and eliminates unnecessary redundancy. It is more concise and easier to understand.
